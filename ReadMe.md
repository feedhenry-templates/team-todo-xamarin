# Xamarin Team To Do Apps

## Overview

Example project to demostrate how to develop cloud-connected native cross-platform apps using [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) and [FeedHenry .NET SDK](https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-dotnet-sdk). 

NOTE: This project only contains the client apps code, and it is using the [FeedHenry TeamToDo Cloud App](https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/team-todo-cloud) as the cloud back end. If you are interested in the cloud code, please check the cloud app's repo instead.
